Feeling stuck? It happens to everyone. Here are some tips to get unstuck:

# Let it all out

"Anything can be rewritten--except nothing." - Joss Whedon

There’s nothing scarier than a blank slate. Free-writing is the process of
getting all of your thoughts out in the open, no matter how messy they are.
Set a timer for 10 minutes and don’t let your pen stop moving or fingers
stop typing until the clock runs down. It’s ok if you’ve written gibberish.
You can always go back and edit your ideas into a spectacular story.

# Try a different medium

If you’re story is highly visual, try writing instead. Already have a lot
written? Record yourself telling the story -- out loud, no notes. Draw a
picture that illustrates your story, or create a slideshow or video of it.
How would you tell your story with LEGO blocks? When you switch to a new
tool, you often find a new voice.

# Give yourself a deadline

A clock ticking down is a storyteller’s best friend. Try breaking youri
story into manageable chunks and give yourself intermediate deadlines:
complete at least one section by the end of the day, finish editing the
photos and writing captions by the end of the week, etc. If you aren’t 
good at setting your own deadlines, ask a friend or colleague to hold you 
accountable.

# Share your story with someone you trust

Unleashing your story for the world to see is a daunting task, so try
showing it to someone you trust first. Your story is better than you think,
and getting feedback before you publish it will boost your confidence. 
Tip: If you preview your Floodlight story, you can use the link to share it
with others -- even if it’s not published yet.
