            Many families in metro Denver have to make a hard choice about
            their children's education: a less than optimal school or a
            long, often costly, commute. Colorado is a "choice" state,
            which means children can attend any public school. It doesn't
            have to be in their neighborhood, or even in their school
            district. But the caliber of schools is not equally distributed
            across the metro area. Even if a family decides a quality
            education is worth hours of daily commuting, they may not be
            able to afford it. A survey of 600 families in Denver and
            Washington, D.C. - a choice district - by the Center on
            Reinventing Public Education found that transportation
            difficulties prevented a quarter of parents from sending their
            children to their preferred schools. Among families with the

            build out of the FasTracks light rail system are creating new
            opportunities and challenges for creating a supportive 
            education environment for all children.
