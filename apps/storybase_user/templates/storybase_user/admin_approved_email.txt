Hello from the {{ site_name }} team. Per your request, weâ€™ve created an {{ obj_class }} for {{ obj_name }} on {{ site_name }}.

You can view your {{ obj_class }} here: {{ obj_url }}

Your {{ site_name }} account is now listed as a member of your {{ obj_class }}, so when you create and publish stories on {{ site_name }} you will be able to add them to your {{ obj_class }} page. You can find instructions for how to do that here: http://floodlightproject.org/en/help/#projects-and-organizations

Please contact us at {{ contact_email }} if you have any other questions.

Happy storytelling,
The {{ site_name }} Team
